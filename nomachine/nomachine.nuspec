## Update from 8.2.4.9- versions on 64 bits environment

From 8.2.4.10, chocolatey packaging choose nomachine 64 bits on 64 bits environment, but x86 to x64
upgrade by nomachine installer does not work.

You need to uninstall nomachine (also check windows add/remove applications) before reinstalling
it with chocolatey.

## x86 and x86_64 (from 8.4.2.100)

From 8.4.2.100 installation uses appropriate packaging based on architecture and `--x86` option.

## Package behavior (from 6.6.8.501)

Chocolatey package automatically enables *Print Spooler* service as it is needed
for a successful NoMachine installation
